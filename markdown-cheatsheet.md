## PARAGRAPHS / LINE BREAKS

To write a paragraph all you need to do is start typing.
You can add a line break in the code view but it will stay in paragraph form until you add an extra line like:

That.

Or, if you want to start a new line, add two spaces to the end of the line.  
then you can  
enter  
as many words as you would like per line.

## EMPHASIS / BOLDING

### Italics

You can do italics like  
*this* or _this_ however, it's probably best to go with *this one*

### BOLDING

Works just like italics, however it is double '**' like:  
**bold words**

### BOLD & ITALICS

***this is bold and italics***
